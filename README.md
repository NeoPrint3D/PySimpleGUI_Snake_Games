# PySimpleGUI_Snake_Games
A game made from pysimple for my little project

*Warning
Since the keyboard module requires root to access raw input data 
there is a second verion using built in buttons called snake_game_linux.py


My goals:
  familar to using arrays and extracting the values for meaningful purposes in the game
  
  accessing and storing data through a bsaic text file(High scores)
  
  Getting better with just basc value storing and accesing across the entire game
